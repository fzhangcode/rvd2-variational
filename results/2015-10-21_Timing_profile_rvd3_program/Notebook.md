2015-10-21 Timing profile rvd3 program
==============================

Purpose
------------
Generate a timing table by a timing profile to see what function is taking the most time.

Conclusions
-----------------

Integration for optimizing gamma in E-step and optimizing M in M-step takes most of the time.
