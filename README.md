# rvd2-variational

## Introduction

We developed a variational EM algorithm for a hierarchical Bayesian model to identify rare variants in heterogeneous next-generation sequencing data. 
Our algorithm is able to identify variants in a broad range of read depths and non-reference allele frequencies with high sensitivity and specificity.
In an analysis of a directed evolution longitudinal yeast data set, we are able to identify a time-series trend in non-reference allele frequency and detect novel variants that have not yet
been reported. 
Our model also detects the emergence of a beneficial variant earlier than was previously shown, and a
pair of concomitant variants.
